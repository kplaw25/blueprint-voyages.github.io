    <h1 class="section-title">Dream Trips Are Fantastic — But Planning Them Isn’t</h1>
    <p class="lead">We all love to imagine the perfect getaway. But turning that dream into reality takes endless time and research — time most of us don’t have. That’s where I come in.</p>

    <div class="card card-questions">
      <ul class="question-list">
        <li>Which flights or trains actually make sense for my route?</li>
        <li>Should I stay in a hotel or Airbnb — and in which neighborhood?</li>
        <li>How do I choose between the 50 identical-looking tours?</li>
        <li>Which restaurants are worth my time and money?</li>
        <li>Do I need a Swiss Travel Pass, or just a Swiss Day Pass?</li>
        <li>Which mountain hike is best for moderate effort and stunning views?</li>
        <li>What’s the cheapest way to get phone service abroad?</li>
        <li>Where is that lost confirmation email for my flight, hotel, or excursion?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="personal-note">Instead of drowning in the details, you get to dream and decide what excites you most. I’ll handle the time-consuming research, organization, and coordination — so all you have to do is book the final activities and enjoy the trip of a lifetime with everything at your fingertips.</p>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>“Full disclosure, Kelsey is my Daughter-in-law. When she and my son decided to have a destination wedding in Italy, with additional stops in France and Switzerland, she handled ALL of the arrangements. Airline flights, hotels, rental cars, even down to the Metro tickets and details on which lines to take in Naples, Rome and Paris. There was no pressure on me to make any preparations. So, if you want a planner to handle it all for you, Kelsey, is the one to do it.” <br><strong>- Brian Espensen</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>“Kelsey planned my trip to Rome for her wedding, and I can't say enough about how seamless she made the experience. Everything was so organized and well thought out, which took away so much of the stress that usually comes with international travel. From navigating bookings and commutes to bridging the language barrier, she handled it all. Because of her, I was able to truly enjoy the trip and focus on the experience instead of the logistics! 12/10 experience. One word to describe the trip "magical". <br><strong>- Emma Becker</strong></p>
