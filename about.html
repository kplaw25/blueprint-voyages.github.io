          <h2>Hi, I'm Kelsey!</h2>
          <p>I discovered my passion for travel planning while organizing my destination wedding in Italy and coordinating travel for 28 guests. What started as a labor of love turned into a month-long European adventure across four countries and seven cities.</p>
          <p>With a background as a Data Scientist, I bring an analytical and detail-oriented mindset to travel planning. I love digging into the logistics, researching options, and creating smooth, enjoyable travel experiences that are fully customized for each person I work with.</p>
          <p>I'm not a travel agent—I’m a travel planner. That means you stay in control of the booking process, but I’ll guide you step by step and help you find the right flights, lodging, and activities to bring your dream trip to life. I love collaborating with people to make travel simple, stress-free, and truly unforgettable.</p>
